# CS-370-AI-Intellgent-Agent-Maze


    Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
    
    The objective of the code was to build a Ai that solves an Ai that uses Q-learning to find the best possible path to the treasure through a maze. We used this my designing and intellegint agent that gets the best path from an advisor that has run the maze many times and has dictated the best possible solution to the agent. We begin by importing tensor flow libraries and to train train the network. We then set up the environment and setting up the agent and advisor with the advisor running the maze over and over. Then the Advisor will take the most successful run and have the agent run that path as it was the most successful. This system uses a point system to dictate whether the treasure was reached. Points were awarded for making progress in the maze rewarded 1 point and points were not earned if no progress was made. Then they were added up to provide the last solution with the most points.
    
    
    
    Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
        What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
        
        Computer scientist create systems that process data and feed it into a machine learning algorithm and Ai that will be provided a problem and train on the problem until they output the best possible solution. They design systems to organize the data and feed it into a system that will supply the best possible output or solition. 
        
        How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
        
        To approach a problem as a computer scientist the best way is to start by thinking of "what is the objective of the system?" and "what are the problems we are trying to solve?". We must also consider what kind of information we need and if we have access for that data. We must design a system that can solve these problems and in a fast and efficent way. 
        
        What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
        
        My ethical responsibilities are to protect user privacy, to abide by the rules of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). We must inform users how their data is being used, how long we are holding their data, and we are only asking for data we need and nothing more. I must also understand their may be potential bias in my Ai and to design Ai without the intention of bias. I must also make sure the data that I am using is accurate as well and not obselete or outdated.
